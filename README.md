**Dawscape** is an escape room game built with Java Swing, using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern. It offers an interactive and immersive experience where players solve puzzles and navigate through scenes to escape.


## Features

### **Model**
- Manages game scene data and objects discovered by the player.
- Defines random variables for each game session, ensuring unique gameplay every time.
- Supports saving, exporting, and importing game sessions for continuity.

### **View**
- Displays the game interface, presenting scenes and events to the player.
- Dynamically updates based on player actions, such as picking up objects or interacting with the environment (e.g., opening drawers or doors).

The scenes were originally designed using **SketchUp** and rendered with **Indigo Renderer**, ensuring high-quality visuals. Each image depicts a detailed scene with interactive objects.

### **Controller**
- Acts as a bridge between the Model and View, handling user inputs and coordinating updates between the two.
